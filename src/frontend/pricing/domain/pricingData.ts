    question: "How does the 2% transaction fee work?",
    answer:
      "We charge 2% on all sales made through your connected marketplace accounts. Once you reach $40 in fees for the month, you pay nothing more - it's capped at $40/month maximum.",
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as a transaction?",
    answer:
      "Any sale completed through your connected Etsy, eBay, Depop, Poshmark, or Mercari accounts counts as a transaction. We only charge on successful sales, not on listings or failed transactions.",
  },
  {
    question: "When do I pay the transaction fees?",
    answer:
      "Fees are automatically deducted from your connected payment accounts when sales are processed. You'll receive detailed monthly statements showing all transactions and fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't make any sales?",
    answer:
      "If you don't make any sales in a month, you pay nothing! Our pricing is completely performance-based - you only pay when you're making money.",
